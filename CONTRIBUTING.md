Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pelagornis! We welcome contributions of all kinds. Please read the following guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration.

## Development


## Releasing

To create a new release, use the GitHub UI at: [Pelagornis Releases](https://github.com/pelagornis/)

### Versioning

Follow semantic versioning when creating tags:

- Major version bump: If the update requires users to modify their workflows, increment the major version and note the breaking change in the release notes.

- Minor version bump: If you add a new workflow or an opt-in feature, increment the minor version.

- Patch version bump: If you fix a bug or make a transparent change, increment the patch version.

- Leave the release title blank. If you'd like to add additional details, ensure the version number is included. Use the automatically generated changelog as a starting point and supplement it with any necessary details.
